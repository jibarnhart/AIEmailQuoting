# AIEmailQuoting
A repository for my AI email quoting project. This process reads in emails sent to a specific address, matches them up witha  customer and extracts what lane the customer is asking for a quote on. Then it runs that data through a pricing engine and returns back a quote, all within 1-2 minutes.
